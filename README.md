# GooglePlayStoreML
In this Jupyter notebook we use pandas, numpy, pandas profiling for data preprocessiong and for visualization we use matplotlib, seaborn and mostly plotly. By working on the google playstore data we conclude that most of the apps are free and their category are related to family, gaming and certain tools.
